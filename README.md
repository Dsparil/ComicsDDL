This script lets you download commit strips at will whilst organizing them in a dedicated directory structure.

usage :
```
./app.php app:download [comicname]
```

You can set download boundaries depending on the comic (date or strip number), but some of them - *which are not published on a daily basis and/or don't rely on numbering* - don't support boundaries yet... I'll check on this later, as for now I'm looking for more comics / platforms to manage for this project.
